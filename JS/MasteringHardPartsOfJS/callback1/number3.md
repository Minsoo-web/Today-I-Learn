# Exercise 3

## Problem

> Create a function called map that takes two inputs:
> an array of numbers (a list of numbers)
> a 'callback' function - a function that is applied to each element of the array (inside of the function 'map')
> Have map return a new array filled with numbers that are the result of using the 'callback' function on each element of the input array.

`console.log(map([1,2,3],addTwo))` should `[3,4,5]`
