# Exercise 4

## Problem

> The function forEach takes an array and a callback, and runs the callback on each element of the array. forEach does not return anything.

```js
let alphabet = "";
const letters = ["a", "b", "c"];

forEach(letters, function (char) {
  alpharbet += char;
});

console.log(alphabet); // 'abc'
```
